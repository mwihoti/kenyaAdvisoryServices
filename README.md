## Deploying from ICP Ninja

When viewing this project in ICP Ninja, you can deploy it directly to the mainnet for free by clicking "Deploy" in the upper right corner. Open this project in ICP Ninja:

## Project structure

The `/backend` folder contains the Motoko canister, `app.mo`. The `/frontend` folder contains web assets for the application's user interface. The user interface is written using the React framework. Edit the `mops.toml` file to add [Motoko dependencies](https://mops.one/) to the project.

## Build and deploy from the command-line

To migrate your ICP Ninja project off of the web browser and develop it locally, follow these steps. These steps are necessary if you want to deploy this project for long-term, production use on the mainnet.

### 1. Download your project from ICP Ninja using the 'Download files' button on the upper left corner under the pink ninja star icon.

### 2. Setting up Ollama

To be able to test the agent locally, you'll need a server for processing the agent's prompts. For that, we'll use `ollama`, which is a tool that can download and serve LLMs.
See the documentation on the [Ollama website](https://ollama.com/) to install it. Once it's installed, run:

```
ollama serve
# Expected to start listening on port 11434
```

The above command will start the Ollama server, so that it can process requests by the agent. Additionally, and in a separate window, run the following command to download the LLM that will be used by the agent:

```
ollama run llama3.1:8b
```

The above command will download an 8B parameter model, which is around 4GiB. Once the command executes and the model is loaded, you can terminate it. You won't need to do this step again.

### 3. Open the `BUILD.md` file for further instructions.
